# Express.js Async Operation Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications when dealing with asynchronous operations, specifically when handling cases where data might not be found.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect handling, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file attempts to fetch user data from a database. If the user is not found, it correctly returns a 404 status. However, if an error occurs during the database operation or if the `userData` variable is unexpectedly undefined, the application crashes without proper error handling.  This leads to a bad user experience and makes debugging challenging.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file showcases the correct approach. It uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during database operations.  Even if the user is not found, it returns a more informative and consistent response.  This ensures the application remains stable and provides better feedback to the user.
